My research focuses on understanding the intricacies of star formation and stellar physics, leveraging extensive datasets. I employ advanced methodologies, including machine learning techniques, statistical inference, and predictive modeling, to analyze data from leading astronomical surveys such as SDSS-V/APOGEE, Gaia, LAMOST, and CSST. **Specifically, my work centers on the identification and statistical analysis of binary stars, the stellar initial mass function (**IMF**), and the physics of stellar atmosphere models.** These areas are fundamental to my broader investigation into stellar populations and the assembly history of the Milky Way.
