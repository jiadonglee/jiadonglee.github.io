My research interests are star formation, Galactic evolution, and the history of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies in light of large data sets. To investigate these subjects, I use machine learning, statistical inferences, and forward models for dealing with data from ongoing and future large-scale surveys, e.g., SDSS-V, APOGEE, Gaia, LAMOST, and CSST. **I care about the properties of stellar populations, such as stellar initial mass function, vertical motion history, and chemical evolution of the Galaxy.**

Before that, I make use of novel machine-learning methods to measure stellar parameters of spectroscopic surveys. Recently, I have been working on applying novel natural language processing techniques to interpret the hidden information in spectroscopy when deriving labels. This is an essential advancement following the step of data-driven methods of stellar parameters.
