My research focuses on understanding the intricacies of star formation, the evolutionary processes of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and their historical contexts, leveraging extensive datasets. I employ advanced methodologies, including machine learning techniques, statistical inference, and predictive modeling, to analyze data from leading astronomical surveys such as SDSS-V, APOGEE, Gaia, LAMOST, and CSST. **My primary interest lies in the exploration of stellar populations, emphasizing the stellar initial mass function, vertical motion history, and the chemical evolution of galaxies.**
